# Predicting-TMDb-Top-Film-Ratings

With media and entertainment being such a visible industry, we were interested in exploring the factors that influence voters’ ratings on popular movie databases such as IMDb and TMDb. Our primary research question was: what features and characteristics cause people to “like” or “dislike” a movie, and how does it influence their rating? The main objective of our project was to investigate the factors that affect movie ratings and to determine the extent of their influence.

We used a dataset sourced from Kaggle titled "TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset." For each of the top 5000 movies on TMDb from 2015 and prior, we have information such as rating, runtime, budget and revenue, genre, cast and crew, plot summary, etc. After filtering for movies that have been released during or after 1990, have more than 900 votes, have a positive budget and revenue, we ended up with 927 data points.
